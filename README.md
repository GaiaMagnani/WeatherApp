# WeatherApp
This application is very easy to use and understand because it still need implementation.

In 4 Hours I had made only this version.

I would love to fix:

UI elements / graphic elements
get more weather information from the json
max and min errors ( now you can't see it)
more clean service requester and more OOP like
add awesome functionalities like animation
